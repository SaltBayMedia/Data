    "reviewBody": "A sicko movie whose nastiness is almost topped by its weirdness...so obviously any true horror fan worth their salt needs to seek it out! The story is about a surgeon and a photographer who wake up and to find themselves shackled at opposite ends of a nasty-looking toilet. Don\u0027t want to say too much but plenty of ugliness ensues. This movie has the perfect mix of scares and a really bizarre plot. The movie\u0027s got a decent budget for an indie horror (a little over a million, i think) but it\u0027s pretty small for a film that got such a big release. I hear it made a \"killing\" at the box office, so TAKE NOTICE Hollywood! People want to see this stuff. Go!"
